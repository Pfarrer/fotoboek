# Fotoboek
Fotoboek is a service that indexes your image gallery optimized for viewing many images in nested folders. It will prepare a thumbnail and preview for each image, extract metadata (EXIF mostly) and image paths. With this, you can browse your photos by (recursive) image path, date or, geographic location.

## Core Features
- Show images in chronological order (not filename based)
- Allow recursive image galleries spanning any number of sub-folders
- Pre-calculate preview images as early as possible
- Images are never changed or moved

## Open/Finished Tasks
